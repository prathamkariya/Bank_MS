```text
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=bank_management
EMP_USERNAME=emp_007

* `account_number`, `name`, `date_of_birth`, `phone_number`, `email`, `aadhar_number`, `address`, `account_type`, `balance`.


5. **Run the Application:**
```bash
python main.py

```

### One Final Checklist Before You Upload:
1.  **Update the Image Path:** In your `main.py`, make sure you changed the logo path to `logo_path = "logo.png"` so it loads correctly for everyone.
2.  **Add Your Logo:** Make sure the `logo.png` I generated for you is saved in the same folder as `main.py`.
3.  **Check `.gitignore`:** Ensure `.env` is inside your `.gitignore` so your real password stays private.
